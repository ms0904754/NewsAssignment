# newproject

News Article App.
This Flutter project integrates with the NewsAPI.org service to fetch and display the latest news articles. It provides a structured way to parse, manage, and display news data in a mobile application.
Asynchronous Data Fetching – Uses FutureBuilder to load news data asynchronously and display a loading state.
Structured Data Models – Uses Dart classes (NewsApiResponse, Article, Source) to parse JSON responses into typed objects.
Clean Architecture – Separates data models, API logic, and UI for better maintainability.
